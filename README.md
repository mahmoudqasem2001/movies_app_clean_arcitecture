# Flutter Movies App - Clean Architecture

Welcome to the Flutter Movies App! This application is built using the principles of Clean Architecture to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase. Clean Architecture emphasizes the separation of concerns, making it easier to manage complexity and facilitate testing.

## Getting Started

To run the app, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.
4. Connect a physical device or emulator to your development environment.
5. Run `flutter run` to launch the app on your device.

## Architecture Overview

The Flutter Movies App follows Clean Architecture, comprising three layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This layer contains the UI, user interaction components, and view models. It is responsible for rendering the data and handling user inputs.

2. **Domain Layer**: The domain layer holds the business logic and use cases of the application. It is independent of any specific framework and defines the core functionalities of the app.

3. **Data Layer**: The data layer handles data retrieval from various sources, such as API calls, databases, or local storage. It includes repositories and data mappers to convert raw data into domain models.

## Dependencies

The Flutter Movies App uses various packages for state management, dependency injection, and networking. Some of the key dependencies include:

- `flutter_bloc` for managing the application's state using the BLoC pattern.
- `get_it` for handling dependency injection in a simple and efficient manner.
- `http` package for making API calls to fetch movie data.
- `equatable` for simplifying equality comparisons between objects.
